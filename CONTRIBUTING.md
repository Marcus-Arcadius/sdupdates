# How do I request an addition, deletion, and/or change to this Github?

If it's request with clear details and you don't know how to/want to create a pull request, leave an issue with the appropriate tag and I'll take a look at it.

    For example: If you had an embed that I happened to miss and don't want to create a pull request, link it with the tag "Models Embeds Hypernets"

Otherwise, create a pull request with the changes

    For example: If you had a formatting change to the github/rentry, send a PR request and I'll see if I can merge it.

If it's a proposed change that isn't on a scale of a request, discuss it in the discussions before turning it into an issue/PR

    For example: Discussing potential changes to the formatting without a clear roadmap on what should be changed should be in the discussions (and tagged)
